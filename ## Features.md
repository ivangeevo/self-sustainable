# Self Sustainable List of features


## Working:


* Minimises the saturation that the player spawns with.
* Removes the logic for saturation based healing, & difficulty based healing.
* Healing every 30 seconds, instead of when the hunger bar is full.
* Periodic exhaustion regardless of action(to prevent infinite afk-ing).
* Removed the random respawning of passive mobs in the world.
* Increased exhaustion from jumping & even more from sprinting/sprint jumping.


## Partially working:
## ***Brick Oven -
* Working:Adding and retrieving items, 
* TODO:Fuel Overlay(or blockstate?), Falling block logic for it,
